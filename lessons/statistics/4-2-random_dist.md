[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

**Exercise 2**  
*The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.*

> Generate 1000 numbers from random.random.*

```python
>>> nums = np.random.random(1000)
>>> nums[:10]
array([0.35490748, 0.23560738, 0.41897198, 0.5684907 , 0.62594531,
       0.24709504, 0.0886374 , 0.93151124, 0.87029059, 0.71507647])
```

Every value of the array ```nums``` is a random number between 0 and 1.

> Plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

```python
>>> pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(nums)
>>> thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
>>> thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')
```

Let's take a look at the ```x-axis``` *Random variate*:
- each value is a number between 0 and 1,
- **each value has a probability of ```1 / 1000``` or ```0.001```**

If we plot the **Cumulative distribution function**, this is the sum of each probability in the dataset:

```python
>>> cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(nums)
>>> thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
>>> thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')
```

![!](cdf_nums.png)

The sum of each one of the probabilities (```0.001```) is ```1```.
